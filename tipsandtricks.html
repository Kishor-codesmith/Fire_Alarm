                                            risk of a fire in your home</li>
                                        <li>1. Assign a special closet for combustible materials and dangerous tools
                                            that you do not want your children to touch. Put a good lock on the door and
                                            a heat detector inside to alert you to any fire danger.</li>
                                        <li>2. Do not overload electrical circuits with too many applications. If your
                                            fuses are blowing or your circuit breakers are poping, hire an electrician
                                            to look at your system.</li>
                                        <li>3. Nails or staples used to attach electrical cords to the walls or
                                            baseboards can demage the cords and cause fire or shock hazards. </li>
                                        <li>4. Keep combustibles away from the furnace, which can emit flames or sparks.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>5. Some fire departments supply stickers that can be placed in a window to
                                            alert firefighters to the presence of a child or an elderly or physically
                                            challenged person.Determine whether such stickers are available in your
                                            locality.</li>
                                        <li>6. Unplug your hair dryer or any other small appliance in the bathroom when
                                            not in use.</li>
                                        <li>7. Be sure to turn a heating pad off before you go to sleep. It can cause
                                            burns even at a relatively low setting.</li>

                                        <li>1. Consider having one or more working fie extinguishers in your home. An
                                            extinguisher rated A B C is recommended for home use. Many fire extinguisher
                                            models are designed for one time use and cannot be recharged.</li>
                                        <li>2. Get training from the fire department or a fire extinguisher
                                            manufacturer. Fire extinguishers from various manufacturers operate in
                                            different ways and there is no time to read directions during an emergency.
                                            Only adults should handle and use extinguishers</li>
                                        <li>3. When caught in smoke, cover your mouth and nose with wet cloth!</li>
                                        <li>4. If you try to use a fire extinguisher on a fire and the fire does not
                                            immediately die down, drop the extinguisher and get out. Most portable
                                            extinguishers empty in 8 seconds.</li>

                                        <li>1. In new homes, The national Fire Alarm Code requires hard-wired,
                                            interconnected smoke alarms with battery back-up on every level of the home,
                                            outside each sleeping area, and wired together so that if one sounds, they
                                            all sound.</li>
                                        <li>2. In existing homes If smoke alarms are not already in place, at a minimum
                                            install them on every level of the home and outside each sleeping area. If a
                                            fire occurs inside a bedroom, dangerous gases can cause heavier sleep.For
                                            the best protection, install interconnected smoke alarms in each bedroom and
                                            throughout the home. When one sounds, they all sound.</li>
                                        <li>3. Use the test button to test your smoke alarms at least monthly. The test
                                            feature tests all electronic functions and is safer than testing with a
                                            controlled fire (matches,lighters,cigarettes).</li>
